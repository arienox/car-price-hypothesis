# car-price-hypothesis
This code performs a hypothesis test to determine if the mean of the enginesize variable in the CarPrice_Assignment.csv dataset is equal to 120. The null hypothesis is that the mean is equal to 120, and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean is not equal to 120. The code calculates the mean of the enginesize variable and then performs a t-test with a confidence level of 95%. The p-value of the test is calculated, and if it is less than the significance value (1-confidence level, or 0.05 in this case), the null hypothesis is rejected. In this case, the p-value is 0.9908, so the null hypothesis is not rejected.
